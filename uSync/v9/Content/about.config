      <Value><![CDATA[<p>Born From a mutant weaver spider that ate radioactive wool, the Twisty Yarnster had the skills to crochet and knit anything! </p>
<p>Seriously though, she is a lovely lady from humble origins. Born in central united states to a christian home. She grew up with a love of music and the love of creating. Through hard work and practice she gained her skills in Crochet and Knitting as a hobby to pass the time. It is a passion to create that called her to bring her skills to others. First as baby shower gifts and now here to reach more people.</p>]]></Value>
